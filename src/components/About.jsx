                Hello, my name is Sean Harrell and I'm a San Diego-based Jr.
                Software Engineer who is not afraid to handle problems head on.
                While my path to web development is filled with plenty of twists
                and turns, my experiences have shaped me into what I believe is
                an asset within a work setting.{" "}

              <p className="mb-4">
                My previous administrative experience has allowed me to exercise
                a strong sense of organization, problem solving, communication,
                and time-management. I was entrusted with semi-sensitive
                responsibilities for San Diego's Community College District,
                working closely with the Vice Chancellor, and I was noted for
                quickly learning the ins and outs of the Development Services
                systems for the City of San Diego. <br />

              <p className="mb-5">
                While I enjoy collaborative team-settings where creativity can
                be exchanged, I am dependable as a single player as well. As a
                newly bootcamp graduate, I am excited to dive into what lays
                ahead, learning all that I can along the way!{" "}
